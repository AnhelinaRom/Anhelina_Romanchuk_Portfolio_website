                    <p>I began my journey at a Ukrainian university, enrolling there after being 
                        accepted. Initially, I had limited knowledge of software development and 
                        found the learning curve challenging. However, through diligent study, 
                        I quickly advanced and secured the second position in my class. My interest 
                        in game development grew as I explored how games are made, leading me to 
                        decide on a future in this field. For now, I'm enjoying the creative process 
                        of building websites while honing my skills for the future.</p>

                    <p>I am a 20-year-old Ukrainian woman who is shy yet outgoing and loves tackling new 
                        challenges, even though they can be stressful. I have a background in music and dance, 
                        I have a strong interest in Asian culture, including anime, K-pop, doramas, and 
                        video games, which enrich my creative perspective. As I continue to grow in web 
                        development, I am excited to blend my diverse interests and experiences into my work.</p>

                    <p>Although I began coding unsure of my future, I quickly discovered that web 
                        development is my true passion. The satisfaction of solving complex problems 
                        and my love for video games guided me to this field. While studying in college,
                        I continuously expand my skills in new languages and frameworks. 
                        I am also a self-taught 3D modeler and am currently learning 
                        digital drawing. These skills enhance my ability to create engaging websites.
                        Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage my web development and 3D modeling 
                        expertise to pursue opportunities in the game development industry.</p>
